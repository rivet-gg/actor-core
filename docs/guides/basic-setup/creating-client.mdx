# Creating a Client

To interact with your actors, you need to create a client connection. ActorCore provides a straightforward client API with full type safety.

## Basic Client Creation

```typescript
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./app"; // Import your app type for type safety

// Create a client with the server URL
const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");

// Connect to a specific actor
const counter = await client.counter.get();

// Call actions on the actor
const newCount = await counter.increment(5);
console.log(newCount); // 5
```

## Connection with Options

You can provide options when connecting to actors:

```typescript
// Connect with authentication token and custom ID
const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get({
  // Pass parameters to the actor
  params: {
    userId: "user-123",
    authToken: "jwt-token-here"
  },
  
  // Specify a custom ID for the actor
  id: "room-abc",
  
  // Connection options
  options: {
    reconnect: true, // Enable automatic reconnection
    retryLimit: 5,   // Maximum reconnection attempts
    timeout: 5000    // Connection timeout in milliseconds
  }
});
```

## Creating a New Actor Instance

If you need to explicitly create a new actor instance:

```typescript
// Create a brand new game room
const gameRoom = await client.gameRoom.create({
  params: {
    name: "Multiplayer Match",
    maxPlayers: 4,
    gameMode: "capture-the-flag"
  }
});

// The ID is generated by the server
console.log(gameRoom.id); // "game-123"
```

## Connecting to a Specific Actor ID

If you know the actor ID, you can connect directly:

```typescript
// Connect to a specific game room by ID
const gameRoom = await client.gameRoom.getWithId("game-123", {
  params: {
    playerName: "Alice"
  }
});
```

## Handling Connection Events

The client provides events for connection state changes:

```typescript
// Create the client
const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");

// Listen for connection events
client.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to server");
});

client.on("disconnected", () => {
  console.log("Disconnected from server");
});

client.on("reconnecting", (attempt) => {
  console.log(`Reconnection attempt ${attempt}`);
});

client.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error("Connection error:", error);
});
```

## Client Cleanup

To properly clean up resources when you're done with the client:

```typescript
// Dispose of the client when no longer needed
client.dispose();
```

The client API provides a seamless way to interact with your actors, with automatic reconnection handling and full type safety throughout your application.
